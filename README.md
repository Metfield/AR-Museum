# AR-Museum
gARffiti or Museum ARtist... lets you be the author of an augmented reality art exhibition at your museum

Using augmented reality, the application enables the user to paint on a virtual canvas projected onto the physical space through the userâ€™s handheld device. 
Multiple users can paint on the same canvas at the same time thanks to a shared application server.

Screenshots of the application GUI. At the top is a slider acting as color palette. Close to the bottom is another slider providing brush size optionality
